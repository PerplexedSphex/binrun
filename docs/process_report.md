So you're not actually listening over any sort of network interface altogether. Um, now you don't have to do this. You can actually have an in-process connection and um, a network available to you.

    "transcription_summary": "And enable logging Boolean. And let's start with enable logging because that one's the simplest. Um, to enable logging, we first need a reference to our NATS server. And we can just say if uh, enable logging, we can say NATS server.configure configure logger. Um, and that's simply going to turn the NAT server logging on, which is great. And it also tells us that we're listening on port 4222. So we are indeed going over the network. Um, okay, great. So now let's uh implement our second piece, which is the in-process connection. So there's a couple pieces to this, um, but basically the the both the client and the server have the ability to kind of um, shim out the network or provide a different interface for that network connection. Um, so we can bypass the network all together and really just use kind of an in-memory way of passing data around. So um, so the first thing we want to do is, and this is completely optional, but we actually have an option in the the NAT server options to say don't listen. And what this is going to do is it's going to um, basically, if we set in process to true, it's going to tell the NAT server to not listen on any port. So you're not actually listening over any sort of network interface altogether. Um, now you don't have to do this. You can actually have an in-process connection and um, a network available to you. But just to kind of illustrate what this looks like, if I set don't listen to, um, true, let's go ahead and set this to true over here. And I go ahead and run this. Um, we're actually going to close. And the reason for that is that NAT's client try to connect, it ran into an error and we did a log.fatal. So we actually crashed the program. Um, but the interesting thing is is the server was ready and it didn't actually have that log line saying that it's going over the network. Um, which is great. Um, so you can actually create this like really closed, um, application and use the NAT server without actually exposing any sort of, you know, network interface to it, which I think is really cool. Um, but let's actually uh, we'll we'll keep this around for now. But um, what we'll actually do is let's set up that in-process connection so that client can actually successfully connect to the NAT server. And so the way that we do this is we need to pass in a particular client operation, or a client option into um our connection logic so that uh the client can know that it needs to connect directly to the NAT server using an in-process connection. So let's go ahead and uh, right above our connect call, we're going to say, uh we're going to define some client options. And this is just going to be array of, uh, NAT's dot options. All right. And we'll keep it blank for now, um, but what we want to do is if we set in process to true, then we want to append uh, new client options. Uh, client ops, NAT's dot in process server, um, and the NAT server. Now, the cool thing about this is this in-process server is just a option that you pass into the the NATs client. Um, but it actually takes an interface called the in-process connection provider. And so, um, while this is being provided directly by the NAT server, you can actually create, you know, whatever interface you want for this, um, which is really nice because you can go, you know, shuffle this data via memory or you can go, you know, I guess over a different, um, like network protocol, um, besides TCP, if you wanted. Um, there's some really interesting things that you could do here. So, uh, I think this is pretty cool. Um, let's pass this option into, um, our connection and let's test this out.",

So if I say uh NATS request hello.world hi hi, um I still get a response here, which is nice. And we actually have like much better performance because we don't have to go over the network interface. Um, now how much better performance? Let's actually find that out. Back to our code, I'm just going to go turn don't listen back to on, um, and we'll close out this server and I've actually set up a benchmark. Um, this benchmark is going to test the in-process connection as well as the loopback interface and kind of see like how much faster the in-process connection is. So, uh, let's go ahead and run this benchmark and, um, see what we get. Okay, so now that we ran the benchmark, you can kind of see that we have um, you know, a pretty significant, you know, 4x. Um, and even when I was benchmarking here without running my, uh, my video recording, I was getting like a 5x improvement, um, over, you know, over loopback when using in-process. And so you might not even need this performance because this is like measured in, you know, 16,000 nanoseconds. Um, and this is kind of like, uh, this is a full synchronous request reply that's happening by the way. Um, but as you could see, like we can eek out a lot more performance by doing in-process connections, which is really cool. Um, so you don't have to worry about like incurring any overhead about go, uh, around going through the, um, the network interface. You could actually just like disable it altogether and run a true modular monolith that has a lot of really cool performance with it. Um, okay, what's next? Well, let's go ahead and add JetStream into the mix because, you know, it wouldn't be fun if it was all just core NATS. We want to be able to use JetStream, create streams, create KVs, things like that. And let's actually set up a leaf node connection to, um, to Synadia Cloud so we can see how that all can kind of work, where we have an embedded NATS server inside of our application, but we're still syncing data to Synadia Cloud. And so first and foremost, let's add to our configuration here. We're going to say server name is uh embedded server. And this is what's going to show up when we connect as a leaf node. Um, let's go ahead and say JetStream is true to enable JetStream and um, we're going to also set a JetStream domain. And this is important because we are, uh, what we're going to want to do is we're going to want to connect to Synadia Cloud and we want to be able to administer our, you know, JetStream, maybe create a stream, key value stores, things like that. Um, but we need a JetStream domain to be able to identify, um, all of these stream assets, like streams and KVs and, and which kind of bucket or, uh, server, NATS system, they belong to. Um, so I'm going to call this embedded as my JetStream domain and we'll use that a little bit later. And then we're going to actually fire up a leaf node, um, configuration block. And I'm just going to copy and paste over here. Um, what this is going to be doing is it's going to create a, uh, a leaf node remote connection, um, to a URL called leaf URL, which I'll just go create over here. Um, and we'll say that leaf URL is, uh, it's a URL type. And so we'll just, uh, go over here and say URL.parse.

Um, let's go ahead and run this and see if, uh, this is all going to be working correctly. Go run main.go. Okay, so I have some warnings here, um, and those that was just from some previous examples that has nothing to do with, uh, any of this. But you can see that we are, um, running the in the embedded domain, um, that we have JetStream enabled, and we also are getting messages that we have a successful leaf node connection, um, that, uh, has, has made it over to Synadia Cloud. So let's go over to Synadia Cloud for a minute and, uh, take a look at this. So, there we go. So if I look at my connections graph, you can see I have that, uh, embedded server leaf node. Um, you could see it, it has kind leaf node over here. And if I click into it and scroll down, you could see that I actually have a bunch of subscriptions that were made for me. And this is the subscriptions that are going over the leaf node connection. So things like J's embedded API consumer. You can see the whole, uh, JetStream API has been, um, you know, subscribed to, uh, under the embedded domain. And this is how we're able to talk to this server over JetStream. Um, a couple other, you know, nice neat little things that we're subscribed to. But you can kind of see the subscriptions that all exist right here. So, let's go ahead and go into our CLI. And I'm going to switch my NAT's context, um, to, um, this office hours CLI, which is on the same account that, uh, that this leaf node just connected to. And I'm going to actually say NAT's request hello.world hi hi. And we're getting that hello there, um, as a response. So I'm basically talking to Synadia Cloud, but I'm reaching into that, um, leaf node, uh, and, and that in-process connection is responding and then being forwarded up to Synadia Cloud. So lots of really cool moving pieces going on here, um, but you can see that even though you're using in-process connections, you could still, you know, reach in and all the NAT stuff kind of works as as you would expect, um, which is great. Not only that, but if I do NAT's stream list, these are going to be the streams that are right now inside of my Synadia Cloud account. Um, but I can say, uh, JS domain embedded, and then it's going to list out the streams for this embedded context or domain. Um, and there's no streams defined here, but I can easily add one. I can say NAT stream add and let's call this, um, I don't know, events and we'll use all the defaults. And it's going to ask me for subjects, I'm just going to say events.greater than. And there we go. So now if I run NAT stream list, we now get, um, events, and this is all, you know, inside of my embedded NAT server. Um, the other thing I could do is start sending, uh, events to this. So I can actually say, uh, NAT's, you know, pub, um, events.123, you know, hello, and let's just give them 100. So this is, again, sending it to Synadia Cloud, but this is actually being picked up by the, uh, by the embedded, uh, NAT server because that, um, subscription, you know, has crossed over the leaf node connection. So, if I go ahead and say NAT stream list again, we have 100 messages in that event. So, lots of power here being able to kind of reach into an embedded NAT server, um, but what if I wanted to take these, uh, these events on this NAT server and I wanted to kind of back them up onto Synadia Cloud. Well, I can easily do that by creating a mirror. So I'm going to say, uh, NAT stream add and I'm going to say, um, let's call this, um, I don't know, events and we'll use all the defaults and I also want to say I want to mirror the events, um, stream. Okay. So, it's going to ask me a couple other questions. Do I want to adjust the start time for the mirror? No. Do I want to filter or transform it? No. Um, do I want to import it from a different JetStream domain? Yes, I do. Um, what's our foreign JetStream domain? It's embedded. And so what this is going to do is it's going to create a mirror of that embedded event stream, um, let's go ahead and check it out. NAT stream list. So we're on Synadia Cloud again, and we can see that event's mirror with a hundred messages in it. Now, the really cool part about this is we just created essentially an offline first application where they can use the NATs protocol to interact with JetStream, create events, key value stores, things like that. But we can easily back all of these things up to the cloud and NAT's kind of forwards all that data once, you know, we get connected again to that cloud. And so lots of really, really cool patterns you can express in, um, in a feature like this. And I'm really curious to know how you guys as the community want to use a feature like this and, and maybe what other kind of like capabilities you'd like to mix and match, um, while embedding a NAT server. But, um, that kind of brings our demonstration here to a close. Um, uh, you know, go ahead and jump into the comments below and let me know like what kind of ideas you have or where you'd like to kind of utilize this idea of an embedded NAT server in one of your projects.

    "transcription_summary": "So that client that's listening on hello world is actually talking directly to the NATS server instead of going over the loopback interface. So if I say uh NATS request hello.world hi hi, um I still get a response here, which is nice. And we actually have like much better performance because we don't have to go over the network interface. Um, now how much better performance? Let's actually find that out. Back to our code, I'm just going to go turn don't listen back to on, um, and we'll close out this server and I've actually set up a benchmark. Um, this benchmark is going to test the in-process connection as well as the loopback interface and kind of see like how much faster the in-process connection is. So, uh, let's go ahead and run this benchmark and, um, see what we get. Okay, so now that we ran the benchmark, you can kind of see that we have um, you know, a pretty significant, you know, 4x. Um, and even when I was benchmarking here without running my, uh, my video recording, I was getting like a 5x improvement, um, over, you know, over loopback when using in-process. And so you might not even need this performance because this is like measured in, you know, 16,000 nanoseconds. Um, and this is kind of like, uh, this is a full synchronous request reply that's happening by the way. Um, but as you could see, like we can eek out a lot more performance by doing in-process connections, which is really cool. Um, so you don't have to worry about like incurring any overhead about go, uh, around going through the, um, the network interface. You could actually just like disable it altogether and run a true modular monolith that has a lot of really cool performance with it. Um, okay, what's next? Well, let's go ahead and add JetStream into the mix because, you know, it wouldn't be fun if it was all just core NATS. We want to be able to use JetStream, create streams, create KVs, things like that. And let's actually set up a leaf node connection to, um, to Synadia Cloud so we can see how that all can kind of work, where we have an embedded NATS server inside of our application, but we're still syncing data to Synadia Cloud. And so first and foremost, let's add to our configuration here. We're going to say server name is uh embedded server. And this is what's going to show up when we connect as a leaf node. Um, let's go ahead and say JetStream is true to enable JetStream and um, we're going to also set a JetStream domain. And this is important because we are, uh, what we're going to want to do is we're going to want to connect to Synadia Cloud and we want to be able to administer our, you know, JetStream, maybe create a stream, key value stores, things like that. Um, but we need a JetStream domain to be able to identify, um, all of these stream assets, like streams and KVs and, and which kind of bucket or, uh, server, NATS system, they belong to. Um, so I'm going to call this embedded as my JetStream domain and we'll use that a little bit later. And then we're going to actually fire up a leaf node, um, configuration block. And I'm just going to copy and paste over here. Um, what this is going to be doing is it's going to create a, uh, a leaf node remote connection, um, to a URL called leaf URL, which I'll just go create over here. Um, and we'll say that leaf URL is, uh, it's a URL type. And so we'll just, uh, go over here and say URL.parse. And we'll say we want to connect to NATs leaf connect.ngs.global, which is our Synadia Cloud connection URL. And if error is not nil, we'll go ahead and return that. Perfect. So we've parsed our URL for connecting to, uh, to NGS or Synadia Cloud. And that's truly all we need. So now we have an embedded server that's using JetStream, connecting to Synadia Cloud. Um, let's go ahead and run this and see if, uh, this is all going to be working correctly. Go run main.go. Okay, so I have some warnings here, um, and those that was just from some previous examples that has nothing to do with, uh, any of this. But you can see that we are, um, running the in the embedded domain, um, that we have JetStream enabled, and we also are getting messages that we have a successful leaf node connection, um, that, uh, has, has made it over to Synadia Cloud. So let's go over to Synadia Cloud for a minute and, uh, take a look at this. So, there we go. So if I look at my connections graph, you can see I have that, uh, embedded server leaf node. Um, you could see it, it has kind leaf node over here. And if I click into it and scroll down, you could see that I actually have a bunch of subscriptions that were made for me. And this is the subscriptions that are going over the leaf node connection. So things like J's embedded API consumer. You can see the whole, uh, JetStream API has been, um, you know, subscribed to, uh, under the embedded domain. And this is how we're able to talk to this server over JetStream. Um, a couple other, you know, nice neat little things that we're subscribed to. But you can kind of see the subscriptions that all exist right here. So, let's go ahead and go into our CLI. And I'm going to switch my NAT's context, um, to, um, this office hours CLI, which is on the same account that, uh, that this leaf node just connected to. And I'm going to actually say NAT's request hello.world hi hi. And we're getting that hello there, um, as a response. So I'm basically talking to Synadia Cloud, but I'm reaching into that, um, leaf node, uh, and, and that in-process connection is responding and then being forwarded up to Synadia Cloud. So lots of really cool moving pieces going on here, um, but you can see that even though you're using in-process connections, you could still, you know, reach in and all the NAT stuff kind of works as as you would expect, um, which is great. Not only that, but if I do NAT's stream list, these are going to be the streams that are right now inside of my Synadia Cloud account. Um, but I can say, uh, JS domain embedded, and then it's going to list out the streams for this embedded context or domain. Um, and there's no streams defined here, but I can easily add one. I can say NAT stream add and let's call this, um, I don't know, events and we'll use all the defaults. And it's going to ask me for subjects, I'm just going to say events.greater than. And there we go. So now if I run NAT stream list, we now get, um, events, and this is all, you know, inside of my embedded NAT server. Um, the other thing I could do is start sending, uh, events to this. So I can actually say, uh, NAT's, you know, pub, um, events.123, you know, hello, and let's just give them 100. So this is, again, sending it to Synadia Cloud, but this is actually being picked up by the, uh, by the embedded, uh, NAT server because that, um, subscription, you know, has crossed over the leaf node connection. So, if I go ahead and say NAT stream list again, we have 100 messages in that event. So, lots of power here being able to kind of reach into an embedded NAT server, um, but what if I wanted to take these, uh, these events on this NAT server and I wanted to kind of back them up onto Synadia Cloud. Well, I can easily do that by creating a mirror. So I'm going to say, uh, NAT stream add and I'm going to say, um, let's call this, um, I don't know, events and we'll use all the defaults and I also want to say I want to mirror the events, um, stream. Okay. So, it's going to ask me a couple other questions. Do I want to adjust the start time for the mirror? No. Do I want to filter or transform it? No. Um, do I want to import it from a different JetStream domain? Yes, I do. Um, what's our foreign JetStream domain? It's embedded. And so what this is going to do is it's going to create a mirror of that embedded event stream, um, let's go ahead and check it out. NAT stream list. So we're on Synadia Cloud again, and we can see that event's mirror with a hundred messages in it. Now, the really cool part about this is we just created essentially an offline first application where they can use the NATs protocol to interact with JetStream, create events, key value stores, things like that. But we can easily back all of these things up to the cloud and NAT's kind of forwards all that data once, you know, we get connected again to that cloud.

## Embedding the NATS Server

NATS is a powerful, lightweight, and performant messaging system often used in distributed systems. A typical NATS architecture involves clients connecting over the network to a separate NATS server process or cluster. However, for certain use cases, shipping and managing a separate NATS server alongside your application can introduce complexity. This is where embedding the NATS server directly into your application binary becomes incredibly useful.

Embedding the NATS server means your application process also runs the NATS server logic. This offers significant advantages, particularly for standalone applications, modular monoliths, or environments where a separate NATS daemon is impractical or undesirable. The primary benefit is simplified distribution â€“ your users only need to install and run a single binary. Furthermore, communication between your application's internal components (using the NATS client library) and the embedded NATS server can be optimized to bypass the traditional network stack altogether. This "in-process connection" drastically reduces latency compared to communicating over a network interface like localhost. While network communication via TCP/IP is still possible with an embedded server (and useful if other external processes need to connect), the in-process option provides superior performance for internal communication within your application.

Beyond just core messaging, an embedded NATS server can leverage the full power of NATS JetStream for persistence, streaming, and other advanced features like Key-Value and Object Stores. It can also act as a Leaf Node, connecting to a larger NATS supercluster (like Synadia Cloud or a self-hosted cluster). This allows for powerful hybrid architectures where a local, high-performance embedded server handles immediate, low-latency communication, while seamlessly syncing data with a central cloud-based NATS system for broader connectivity, data durability, or distributed coordination. This is particularly valuable for scenarios requiring offline-first capabilities, where local operations can proceed uninterrupted and then sync with the cloud when connectivity is restored.

Common use cases for embedding a NATS server include:

*   **Offline-first applications with sync:** Desktop or mobile apps that need local messaging and data storage, syncing with a central cloud when online.
*   **Modular Monoliths:** Using NATS as a clean, low-latency communication layer between internal modules within a single large application process, providing clear separation of concerns without the overhead of network calls between modules.
*   **Platforms with no network (e.g., WebAssembly):** Enabling robust messaging and data patterns in environments where a traditional network stack is not directly available.
*   **Unified RPC (Integrated/Local/Global):** Providing a consistent communication interface whether components are within the same process, on the same machine, or distributed globally.
*   **Using NATS "under the hood":** Building applications where NATS is the core communication backbone, but the end-user doesn't need to be aware of its presence or manage it separately.

The following Go code demonstrates how to run a NATS server embedded within an application and connect to it both via the default client URL (network) and using an in-process connection. It also shows how to configure JetStream and set up a Leaf Node connection to Synadia Cloud.

*   Code: Defines \`RunEmbeddedServer\` function, imports \`nats\` and \`server\` packages. Returns \`nats.Conn\`, \`server.Server\`, and \`error\`.
*   Transcription: Explains the function signature and return types. Imports NATS server package. Fixes function name typo. Mentions instantiating server/connection for performance testing.
*   Rewrite Goal: Describe the function signature, its purpose, and the imports needed.

**Object 3:**
*   Code: Adds \`inProcess\` and \`enableLogging\` parameters. Adds \`server.Options\` with \`DontListen\` conditional on \`inProcess\`. Creates server, configures logger, starts server, checks readiness. Defines \`clientOpts\` array. Adds \`nats.InProcessServer\` option conditionally. Returns \`nil\` for now. Adds \`errors\`, \`log\`, \`time\` imports.
*   Transcription: Explains adding parameters \`inProcess\` and \`enableLogging\`. Shows how to configure logger based on \`enableLogging\`. Discusses the \`DontListen\` option in server options, explaining it prevents listening on network ports when \`inProcess\` is true. Mentions the \`InProcessServer\` client option and the \`InProcessConnectionProvider\` interface. Shows the effect of \`DontListen=true\` without the in-process client option (connection fails). Explains how \`nats.InProcessServer(ns)\` connects the client directly to the server's in-memory interface.
*   Rewrite Goal: Detail the added function parameters. Explain \`enableLogging\` and \`ConfigureLogger\`. Explain \`inProcess\` and its effect on \`server.Options.DontListen\`. Explain the purpose of \`DontListen\` (disabling network listening). Explain the \`nats.InProcessServer\` client option and its purpose (connecting client directly to server in-memory). Mention the \`InProcessConnectionProvider\` interface. Describe the code for setting these options and starting the server.

**Object 4:**
*   Code: Sets \`opts.DontListen = inProcess\`. Appends \`nats.InProcessServer(ns)\` to \`clientOpts\` if \`inProcess\`. Connects using \`nats.Connect(ns.ClientURL(), clientOpts...)\`. Returns \`nc, ns, nil\`. Adds \`net/url\` import. Adds leaf node configuration.
*   Transcription: Starts discussing the in-process connection and the client connecting directly without loopback. Runs \`nats request\` command and shows it still works. Mentions performance gain. Goes back to code to turn \`DontListen\` back on for a benchmark (confusing as the code shows \`DontListen\` is still \`inProcess\`). Mentions running a benchmark comparing in-process vs. loopback. Describes benchmark results (4-5x improvement). Discusses using embedded server with JetStream and Leaf Nodes to connect to Synadia Cloud. Adds \`ServerName\`, \`JetStream\`, \`JetStreamDomain\`, \`LeafNode\` options to \`server.Options\`. Parses leaf node URL (\`nats-leaf://connect.ngs.global\`) and includes it in \`LeafNode.Remotes\` with a credentials file path. Connects the client using \`nats.Connect(ns.ClientURL(), clientOpts...)\`.
*   Rewrite Goal: Explain how \`nats.InProcessServer\` enables direct communication. Discuss the performance benefits demonstrated by benchmarking. Introduce adding JetStream and Leaf Node connectivity to Synadia Cloud. Detail the server options added for JetStream (\`JetStream: true\`, \`JetStreamDomain\`) and Leaf Nodes (\`LeafNode\` struct with \`Remotes\`, \`URLs\`, \`Credentials\`). Explain the purpose of these options (enabling JetStream, setting a domain, connecting to a remote NATS system via leaf node). Mention the client connection remains the same, using \`ns.ClientURL()\` (which will be an in-process provider if \`DontListen\` is true and the client option is set, or the local address if \`DontListen\` is false).

**Object 5:**
*   Code: Identical to Object 4. No changes in the code block.
*   Transcription: Continues describing the leaf node configuration added in the previous step. Specifically details parsing the leaf node URL \`nats-leaf://connect.ngs.global\` and configuring the \`LeafNode\` options in the server configuration. Mentions the credentials file. Runs the code (\`go run main.go\`).
*   Rewrite Goal: Reiterate the leaf node configuration details: parsing the URL and setting up the \`LeafNodeOpts\` with remote URLs and credentials. Describe the command run to execute the code. *Since the code is identical to the previous block, this section might be redundant in terms of code changes, but the transcription adds context to the existing code block.* The best approach is probably to combine the description of the leaf node configuration into the previous segment where the code was introduced, or make it clear this segment is just *explaining* the code introduced in the previous segment. Given the prompt asks for a section *for each item*, I should probably make a separate section, but clarify that the code block is the same as the previous one and this section is detailing the setup and running of that code.

**Object 6:**
*   Code: Identical to Object 4 and 5. No changes in the code block.
*   Transcription: Discusses the output of running the code (\`go run main.go\`), noting warnings (irrelevant) and confirmation of embedded domain, JetStream enabled, and successful leaf node connection to Synadia Cloud (NGS). Shows Synadia Cloud UI: confirms the embedded server appears as a leaf node connection, lists subscriptions made over the leaf node (JS API, etc.), showing how communication works. Demonstrates using \`nats request\` from the CLI connected to Synadia Cloud to reach the embedded server's \`hello.world\` subject, showing the response comes back via the leaf node. Explains this shows connectivity and forwarding. Demonstrates \`nats stream list\` on Synadia Cloud, then switching to the embedded domain (\`js domain embedded\`) to list its streams (initially none). Adds a stream (\`nats stream add events\`). Lists streams again on the embedded domain (shows 'events' stream). Publishes messages to the embedded stream (\`nats pub events.123 hello\`). Lists streams again on the embedded domain (shows 100 messages in 'events'). Explains this demonstrates interacting with the embedded JetStream. Shows how to mirror the embedded stream to Synadia Cloud (\`nats stream add events --mirror events\`). Asks if want to import from a different domain (Yes, \`embedded\`). Lists streams on Synadia Cloud again (shows the 'events' mirror with 100 messages). Explains this demonstrates backing up data from the embedded server to the cloud via mirroring and leaf nodes, enabling offline-first patterns. Concludes the demo, asks for community feedback.
*   Rewrite Goal: Describe the successful output of running the code (logging confirms JetStream, Leaf Node). Explain how the Synadia Cloud UI confirms the leaf node connection. Demonstrate interaction: using \`nats request\` from cloud CLI to hit the embedded server via leaf node. Demonstrate JetStream interaction: listing streams on the embedded domain, adding a stream, publishing messages, and confirming message count *on the embedded server* (via the cloud CLI). Demonstrate mirroring: creating a mirror stream on the cloud that pulls from the embedded domain. Explain the significance (offline-first, data backup). Summarize the capabilities shown (embedded server, in-process, JetStream, Leaf Nodes, mirroring) and their benefits.

**Refinement Plan:**
*   Use \`#### Segment X\` as headers.
*   Use Go backticks for code blocks.
*   Rewrite transcription summaries focusing on the core action and concept, removing filler words and conversational elements. Use bullet points if helpful for listing steps or configurations.
*   Ensure the explanation connects the code changes to the described functionality.
*   Mention start/end times near the header or in a note.

\`\`\`go
package main

func main() {

}
\`\`\`

The project is initialized as a basic Go application. The NATS Go client library and the NATS server library will be imported to allow running both within the application. The code for running the server and client will be extracted into a function to facilitate benchmarking later. A new function named \`runEmbeddedServer\` is planned for this purpose.

#### Segment 2 (0m19s - 2m43s)

\`\`\`go
package main

import (

	"github.com/nats-io/nats-server/v2/server"
)

func main() {

}

func RunEmbeddedServer() (*nats.Conn, *server.Server, error) {

}
\`\`\`

The \`RunEmbeddedServer\` function is defined. It is intended to return three values: a NATS connection (\`*nats.Conn\`), a NATS server instance (\`*server.Server\`), and an error. The necessary packages, \`github.com/nats-io/nats.go\` for the client and \`github.com/nats-io/nats-server/v2/server\` for the server, are imported. This function will contain the logic to instantiate the embedded NATS server and connect a client to it.

#### Segment 3 (13m22s - 29m13s)

\`\`\`go
package main

import (
	"errors"
	"github.com/nats-io/nats.go"
	"github.com/nats-io/nats-server/v2/server"
	"log"

)

func main() {
	
	
}

func RunEmbeddedServer(inProcess bool, enableLogging bool) (*nats.Conn, *server.Server, error) {
	opts := server.Options{}
	
	if inProcess {
		opts.DontListen = inProcess
	}
	
	ns, err := server.NewServer(&opts)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, nil, err
	}

	if enableLogging {

	}

	}

	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	

	return nil, nil, nil
}
\`\`\`

The \`RunEmbeddedServer\` function is updated to accept two boolean parameters: \`inProcess\` and \`enableLogging\`.
-   \`enableLogging\`: If true, \`ns.ConfigureLogger()\` is called to enable server logging.
-   \`inProcess\`: This parameter controls whether the server listens on a network interface.
    -   A \`server.Options\` struct is created.
    -   If \`inProcess\` is true, \`opts.DontListen\` is set to true. Setting \`DontListen\` prevents the server from opening any network ports, allowing for purely in-memory communication.
    -   A new server instance is created using \`server.NewServer(&opts)\`.
    -   The server is started in a goroutine using \`go ns.Start()\`.
    -   The code waits for the server to be ready for connections using \`ns.ReadyForConnections\`.

The concept of an "in-process" connection is introduced. This bypasses the standard network stack, allowing the client and server (both running within the same application process) to communicate using shared memory or other direct mechanisms. This can improve performance by removing network overhead.

The code snippet defines server options and starts the server but does not yet include the client connection logic for the in-process mode.

\`\`\`

Building on the previous segment, this code shows how to set up the client connection for in-process communication.
-   A slice of \`nats.Option\` is created (\`clientOpts\`).
-   If the \`inProcess\` parameter is true, the \`nats.InProcessServer(ns)\` option is added to \`clientOpts\`. This is a crucial client option that tells the NATS client to connect directly to the provided \`server.Server\` instance's in-memory interface, bypassing the network.
-   The client connection logic using \`nats.Connect\` is still missing in this specific code block, but the structure for applying the in-process option is shown.

*Note: The code block here seems slightly behind the transcription summary, which describes client connection and even JetStream/LeafNode setup. The next code block aligns better with the transcription.*

\`\`\`

This segment introduces several advanced configurations for the embedded server:
-   **JetStream:** \`opts.JetStream\` is set to \`true\` to enable JetStream. \`opts.JetStreamDomain\` is set to \`"embedded"\` to assign a specific domain name to this JetStream instance. This domain is used to isolate JetStream assets (streams, KVs) and for routing when connected to other NATS systems.
-   **Leaf Node:** A leaf node connection is configured to link this embedded server to a remote NATS system (Synadia Cloud).
    -   The remote URL \`nats-leaf://connect.ngs.global\` is parsed into a \`url.URL\`.
    -   \`opts.LeafNode\` is configured with \`Remotes\`, specifying a list of remote leaf node options.
    -   A \`server.RemoteLeafOpts\` struct is added, containing the parsed remote URL and a path to a credentials file (\`./leafnode.creds\`) for authentication.
-   **Server Name:** \`opts.ServerName\` is set to \`"embedded_server"\` to provide a recognizable name for this server instance, especially when it connects as a leaf node.
-   **Client Connection:** The client connection logic is completed. \`nats.Connect(ns.ClientURL(), clientOpts...)\` is used to connect. \`ns.ClientURL()\` provides the appropriate connection URL for the server (either a network address if \`DontListen\` is false, or a special internal address understood by \`nats.InProcessServer\` if \`DontListen\` is true and the option is included). The \`clientOpts\` slice, which includes the \`InProcessServer\` option when applicable, is passed to \`nats.Connect\`.
-   The function now returns the created \`nats.Conn\` (aliased as \`tnc\` then corrected to \`nc\` in the return) and \`server.Server\` instances, or an error.

*Note: The code block remains identical to the previous two segments. The transcription details the verification and demonstration of the configured features.*

After running the application, the output confirms:
-   The embedded server is running with the "embedded" JetStream domain.
-   JetStream is enabled.
-   A successful leaf node connection to Synadia Cloud (NGS) is established.

Verification steps using the \`nats\` CLI connected to Synadia Cloud:
1.  **Synadia Cloud UI:** The embedded server appears as a "leaf node" connection in the UI, showing that it's linked to the cloud account. Subscriptions for the JetStream API on the "embedded" domain are visible, indicating the cloud can route JetStream requests to the embedded server.
2.  **Core NATS Request/Reply:** Using \`nats request hello.world hi hi\` from the cloud CLI demonstrates routing a request from the cloud, through the leaf node connection, to a handler running on the embedded server. The response travels back via the leaf node, proving connectivity and routing work as expected, even when the embedded server might be using in-process connections internally for local clients.
3.  **JetStream Interaction:**
    -   \`nats stream list\` shows streams in the Synadia Cloud account's *default* domain.
    -   \`nats stream list --js-domain embedded\` switches context to list streams within the *embedded* domain hosted by the embedded server. Initially, there are none.
    -   \`nats stream add events --subjects events.>\` creates a new stream named "events" on the embedded server (via the leaf node connection from the cloud CLI).
    -   \`nats stream list --js-domain embedded\` confirms the new "events" stream exists on the embedded server.
    -   \`nats pub events.123 hello -n 100\` publishes 100 messages to the "events.123" subject, routed via the cloud and leaf node to the embedded server's stream.
    -   \`nats stream list --js-domain embedded\` confirms the 100 messages are stored in the "events" stream on the embedded server.
4.  **JetStream Mirroring:**
    -   \`nats stream add events_mirror --mirror events --import-from embedded\` creates a new stream named "events_mirror" *on Synadia Cloud* that mirrors the "events" stream from the *embedded* domain.
    -   \`nats stream list\` (without domain flag, back on the cloud context) shows the "events_mirror" stream on Synadia Cloud, which now contains the 100 messages mirrored from the embedded server.

This demonstrates the power of combining an embedded NATS server (potentially using in-process communication internally and hosting its own JetStream domain) with leaf node connections to synchronize data and administration with a remote NATS system like Synadia Cloud. This pattern supports use cases like offline-first applications where local data collection can be mirrored to the cloud when connectivity is available.`,

          text: `Here's a thinking process to arrive at the summarized description of the tutorial and its motivation:

1.  **Understand the Goal:** The request asks for the tutorial content and the motivation behind it. This means I need to identify *what* the video teaches and *why* the speaker thinks it's useful or interesting.

2.  **Initial Watch/Scan (Focus on the beginning):**
    *   The speaker starts by mentioning NATS servers and their flexibility ("Lego brick them together," "arbitrary topology").
    *   He immediately pivots to a less-known feature: embedding a NATS server directly into a Go application (0:15-0:18). This is clearly the core topic.
    *   He lists two main benefits (0:19-0:31):
        *   Benefit 1: No need to distribute NATS separately alongside the application. It's self-contained.
        *   Benefit 2: Can bypass the network interface for *in-process* communication, implying a performance advantage.
    *   He states the video's purpose: Show how to write a Go program that embeds NATS, explore available options (0:32-0:39).
    *   There's a standard call to action (like/subscribe) (0:50-1:02).
    *   He reiterates the topic: Embedding NATS (1:04).

3.  **Second Watch/Scan (Focus on the technical explanation and use cases):**
    *   He contrasts the embedded approach with the typical client-server architecture (1:18-1:43), highlighting the network connection and potential latency in the standard model. This reinforces the motivation for embedding.
    *   He explicitly shows the "Embedded Server" diagram (2:09) and mentions it still might connect over localhost (network stack involved).
    *   He then introduces the *key* performance benefit: the "In-Process Connection" (2:37), showing a diagram where the network layer is bypassed (3:36-3:52). This is presented as the *most* interesting aspect of embedding.
    *   He lists specific *Use Cases* (5:36-7:09):
        *   Offline-first applications with sync (uses embedded server locally, syncs via leaf node).
        *   Modular Monoliths (separation of concerns within one binary, performance).
        *   Platforms with no network (like WASM, where you might *need* to provide the network shim).
        *   Unified RPC layer (consistent API regardless of whether components are in-process, local network, or global).
        *   Using NATS "under the hood" (as an implementation detail hidden from the end-user).

4.  **Synthesize the Motivation:**
    *   Why embed NATS?
        *   **Deployment Simplicity:** Package the server *with* the application, no separate dependency management for the user.
        *   **Performance:** Especially with *in-process connections*, bypassing the network stack entirely for maximum speed between components within the same application binary.
        *   **Architectural Flexibility:** Enables patterns like modular monoliths, offline-first apps with sync, and consistent RPC across different deployment scenarios (in-process, local, global).
        *   **Adaptability:** Useful in constrained environments (like WASM) where standard networking might not be available or desirable.
        *   **Abstraction:** Can use NATS as a powerful internal messaging bus without exposing it as a separate infrastructure piece.

5.  **Synthesize the Tutorial Content:**
    *   The tutorial demonstrates how to embed a NATS server within a Go application.

6.  **Structure the Output:** Start with the motivation, explaining *why* someone would want to do this. Then, detail *what* the tutorial actually shows the viewer how to do. Use bullet points for clarity. Refine the language to be concise and accurate based on the video content.

7.  **Review and Refine:** Read through the summary. Does it accurately reflect the video's content and emphasis? Is it easy to understand? Does it cover the key points (embedding, in-process connection, use cases, configuration, code examples)? Ensure the distinction between standard embedding (still using localhost) and in-process embedding (bypassing network) is clear, as the video emphasizes this. Make sure the listed use cases are included.`,

          text: `Okay, here's a summary of the tutorial and its motivation:

**Motivation:**

The speaker introduces embedding a NATS server directly into a Go application as a lesser-known but powerful capability. The primary motivations presented are:

1.  **Deployment Simplicity:** Bundling the NATS server within the application binary eliminates the need for users to install or manage a separate NATS server alongside the application. The entire system becomes a single deployment unit.
2.  **Performance:** While standard embedding might still use the localhost network interface, NATS offers a special **in-process connection** mechanism. This allows components *within the same Go application* to communicate via the embedded NATS server *without* going through the network stack at all, offering significantly lower latency and higher throughput compared to even loopback network connections.
3.  **Architectural Flexibility:** This technique enables various application architectures, such as:
    *   **Modular Monoliths:** Different components within a single binary can communicate via NATS, maintaining separation of concerns while benefiting from high performance.
    *   **Offline-First Applications:** Desktop or local applications can use the embedded NATS server (with JetStream for persistence) locally and then use features like Leaf Nodes or Mirrors to sync data to a central cloud NATS system when connectivity is available.
    *   **Platforms with Limited Networking:** Useful in environments like WASM where direct network socket access might be restricted or need shimming.
    *   **Unified RPC/Messaging:** Provides a consistent NATS-based communication API whether components are in-process, on the local network, or distributed globally.
    *   **Using NATS "Under the Hood":** Implement complex internal communication patterns using NATS as a backbone without exposing it as a separate infrastructure piece to the end-user.

**Tutorial Content:**

The tutorial demonstrates how to:

1.  **Embed the NATS Server:** Shows the Go code required to import the \`nats-server\` package and instantiate a server instance within a Go application's \`main\` function (or a helper function).
2.  **Configure the Embedded Server:** Explains how to use \`server.Options\` to configure the embedded server, similar to using a configuration file for a standalone server.
3.  **Start the Server:** Shows how to start the server, typically in a separate goroutine.
4.  **Wait for Readiness:** Demonstrates how to check if the server is ready to accept connections (\`ReadyForConnections\`).
5.  **Connect a Client:** Shows how a NATS client (within the same Go application) connects to the embedded server:
    *   **Via Network (Loopback):** Connecting using the server's \`ClientURL()\` or the default NATS URL (\`nats://localhost:4222\`).
    *   **Via In-Process:** Using the special \`nats.InProcessServer()\` client option, passing the server instance directly to the client connection call. This bypasses the network stack for maximum performance.
6.  **Demonstrate Basic Functionality:** Shows creating a simple request-reply subscription on the embedded server and making requests to it using the \`nats\` CLI against the default network port.
7.  **Benchmark Performance:** Runs Go benchmarks comparing the request-reply performance of connecting via the loopback network interface versus the high-speed in-process connection, showing a significant performance gain (around 4-5x faster in the demo) for in-process.
8.  **Enable Advanced Features:** Shows how to configure the embedded server to:
    *   Enable JetStream (\`JetStream: true\`).
    *   Set a JetStream domain (\`JetStreamDomain\`).
    *   Configure it as a Leaf Node (\`LeafNode:\`) to connect to a remote NATS system (e.g., Synadia Cloud using credentials).
9.  **Interact with Advanced Features:** Demonstrates interacting with the embedded server's JetStream instance (configured as a leaf node) using the \`nats\` CLI connected to the *remote* Synadia Cloud account, showing how to manage streams (\`nats stream add\`, \`nats stream ls\`) on the embedded server via the leaf node connection.

Essentially, the video guides viewers through setting up an embedded NATS server in Go, highlighting the configuration options, demonstrating the powerful in-process communication for performance, and showing how to integrate it with core NATS features like JetStream and Leaf Nodes for complex use cases.`,

          text: `Here's a thinking process for generating the code snippets and summaries:

1.  **Understand the Goal:** The request asks for the Go code snippets shown in the video tutorial about embedding a NATS server, along with a brief transcript summary describing what the speaker was explaining *while* that specific code was visible on screen.

2.  **Strategy: Video Walkthrough & Code Transcription:** The most reliable way to achieve this is to re-watch the video, pausing at points where significant code is shown or modified.
    *   Identify distinct code blocks or key code modifications.
    *   Transcribe the Go code exactly as shown. Pay attention to imports, function signatures, variable names, and the core logic.
    *   Listen carefully to the speaker's explanation *during* the time that code is visible. Summarize the key point being made about that code.
    *   Keep the summaries concise and focused on *what* the code does or *why* it's being added/changed, as per the speaker's narrative.

3.  **Execution - Step-by-Step Video Review:**

    *   **(0:00 - 1:03): Introduction:** Speaker introduces NATS, its flexibility, and the concept of embedding the server in Go. Mentions benefits like deployment simplicity and in-process communication. No code yet.
    *   **(1:03 - 1:17): Title Card "Embedding NATS":** Transition. Still no specific code, but setting the stage.
    *   **(1:17 - 2:08): Typical NATS Architecture Diagram:** Explains the standard client-server model over the network. No code.
    *   **(2:08 - 3:28): Embedded Server Diagram & In-Process Diagram:** Explains embedding the server *within* the app process. Introduces the concept of connecting via localhost loopback initially, then the superior in-process connection that bypasses the network. Still conceptual diagrams, no specific Go code yet.
    *   **(3:28 - 7:28): Code Introduction & Setup:** Speaker transitions to the code editor.
        *   **(7:29): Initial \`main.go\`:** Shows an empty \`main\` function.
            *   *Code:*
                \`\`\`go
                package main

                func main() {

                }
                \`\`\`
            *   *Summary:* Speaker has created a basic Go project with an empty \`main\` function, ready to start adding code.
        *   **(7:30 - 8:35): Creating \`RunEmbeddedServer\` function:** Speaker creates a helper function to encapsulate server setup for benchmarking later. Imports \`nats.go\` and \`nats-server\`. Defines the function signature returning a NATS connection, a NATS server instance, and an error. Initializes server options.
            *   *Code:* (Combine several intermediate steps shown quickly)
                \`\`\`go
                package main

                import (
                	"log"
                	"time"

                	"github.com/nats-io/nats-server/v2/server"
                	"github.com/nats-io/nats.go"
                )

                func main() {
                	// ... will call RunEmbeddedServer later ...
                }

                // Function to run the embedded server
                func RunEmbeddedServer() (*nats.Conn, *server.Server, error) {
                	opts := &server.Options{} // Initialize server options

                	ns, err := server.NewServer(opts) // Create the server instance
                	if err != nil {
                		return nil, nil, err // Handle error during server creation
                	}

                	// ... server startup and client connection logic will go here ...

                	return nil, ns, nil // Placeholder return
                }
                \`\`\`
            *   *Summary:* The speaker starts by creating a function \`RunEmbeddedServer\` to set up and run the embedded NATS server. This function will return the client connection, the server instance, and any error. Basic server options are initialized, and the \`server.NewServer\` function is called to create the server instance, with error handling.
        *   **(8:35 - 10:07): Starting the server & checking readiness:** Adds code to start the server in a goroutine (\`go ns.Start()\`) and then waits for it to be ready for connections (\`ns.ReadyForConnections\`). Includes a timeout for readiness check.
            *   *Code (inside \`RunEmbeddedServer\`):*
                \`\`\`go
                	// ... (previous setup code) ...

                	go ns.Start() // Start the server in a background goroutine

                	// Wait for the server to be ready for connections, with a timeout
                	if !ns.ReadyForConnections(5 * time.Second) {
                		return nil, nil, errors.New("NATS Server timeout")
                	}

                	// ... client connection logic will go here ...

                	return nil, ns, nil // Placeholder return
                \`\`\`
            *   *Summary:* The code now starts the NATS server asynchronously using a goroutine. It then uses \`ReadyForConnections\` with a 5-second timeout to block until the server is initialized and ready to accept client connections, preventing race conditions.
        *   **(10:07 - 11:07): Connecting the client (Loopback):** Adds code to connect a NATS client to the embedded server using its default client URL (loopback). Adds error handling for the connection. Returns the connection, server, and nil error on success.
            *   *Code (inside \`RunEmbeddedServer\`):*
                \`\`\`go
                 	// ... (server startup and readiness check) ...

                 	// Connect a NATS client to the server's default URL
                 	nc, err := nats.Connect(ns.ClientURL())
                 	if err != nil {
                 		return nil, nil, err // Handle connection error
                 	}

                 	// Return the connection, server instance, and no error
                 	return nc, ns, nil
                }
                \`\`\`
            *   *Summary:* A NATS client connection (\`nc\`) is established using \`nats.Connect\`. It connects to the URL provided by the embedded server instance (\`ns.ClientURL()\`), which typically defaults to \`nats://localhost:4222\`. The function now returns the established client connection and the server instance.
        *   **(11:07 - 12:51): Using the setup in \`main\` & adding subscription:** Calls \`RunEmbeddedServer\` from \`main\`. Adds a simple subscription within \`main\` that responds to "hello.world" requests. Adds \`ns.WaitForShutdown()\` to keep the server running.
            *   *Code (in \`main\` and imports):*
                \`\`\`go
                package main

                import (
                	"log"
                	"time"
                    "errors" // Added errors package

                	"github.com/nats-io/nats-server/v2/server"
                	"github.com/nats-io/nats.go"
                )

                func main() {
                	nc, ns, err := RunEmbeddedServer(false, false) // Call the setup function (flags added later)
                	if err != nil {
                		log.Fatal(err)
                	}

                	// Subscribe to "hello.world" and respond
                	nc.Subscribe("hello.world", func(m *nats.Msg) {
                		m.Respond([]byte("Hello there"))
                	})

                	// Block main goroutine until server shuts down
                	ns.WaitForShutdown()
                }

                // ... RunEmbeddedServer function as previously defined ...
                \`\`\`
            *   *Summary:* The \`main\` function now calls \`RunEmbeddedServer\` to get the client connection and server instance. It then sets up a subscription on the subject "hello.world" using the client connection. When a message is received, it sends back "Hello there". Finally, \`ns.WaitForShutdown()\` blocks the main execution thread, keeping the application (and the embedded server) running until it's terminated.
    *   **(12:51 - 14:06): Running and testing with CLI:** Speaker runs the Go app. Uses \`nats context select default\` and \`nats req hello.world hihi\` in a separate terminal to show the request/reply working over the default network port. No *new* code shown in the editor.
    *   **(14:06 - 15:02): Modifying \`RunEmbeddedServer\` for Logging/In-Process:** Adds boolean parameters \`inProcess\` and \`enableLogging\` to \`RunEmbeddedServer\`. Adds logic to configure the logger and set the \`DontListen\` option based on these flags.
            *   *Code (modifying \`RunEmbeddedServer\` signature and adding logic):*
                \`\`\`go
                // Modified function signature
                func RunEmbeddedServer(inProcess bool, enableLogging bool) (*nats.Conn, *server.Server, error) {
                	opts := &server.Options{
                		// Set DontListen based on the inProcess flag
                		DontListen: inProcess,
                	}

                	// ... (server creation as before) ...

                	// Configure logger if enabled
                	if enableLogging {
                		ns.ConfigureLogger()
                	}

                	// ... (server start and readiness check as before) ...

                	// ... client connection logic will be modified next ...

                	return nc, ns, nil // Return values as before
                }

                // In main, call is updated:
                // nc, ns, err := RunEmbeddedServer(false, true) // Example: enable logging, use network
                \`\`\`
            *   *Summary:* The \`RunEmbeddedServer\` function is updated to accept two boolean flags: \`inProcess\` and \`enableLogging\`. If \`enableLogging\` is true, the server's logger is configured (enabling verbose output). If \`inProcess\` is true, the \`DontListen\` server option is set to true, preventing the server from opening a network port.
    *   **(15:02 - 17:47): Implementing In-Process Connection Logic:** Adds logic to use \`nats.InProcessServer()\` client option when \`inProcess\` flag is true. Explains this option takes the server instance directly. Creates a \`clientOpts\` slice to hold connection options.
            *   *Code (modifying client connection part of \`RunEmbeddedServer\`):*
                \`\`\`go
                	// ... (server setup, start, readiness check) ...

                	// Prepare client options slice
                	clientOpts := []nats.Option{}

                	// If inProcess is true, add the InProcessServer option
                	if inProcess {
                		clientOpts = append(clientOpts, nats.InProcessServer(ns))
                	}

                	// Connect the client using the server URL and potentially the in-process option
                	nc, err := nats.Connect(ns.ClientURL(), clientOpts...) // Pass variadic options
                	if err != nil {
                		return nil, nil, err
                	}

                	return nc, ns, nil // Return values as before
                \`\`\`
            *   *Summary:* The client connection logic is modified. A slice for \`nats.Option\` is created. If the \`inProcess\` flag is true, the \`nats.InProcessServer(ns)\` option is appended to this slice. This option tells the \`nats.Connect\` call to directly use the provided server instance (\`ns\`) for communication, bypassing the network entirely. The options slice is then passed to \`nats.Connect\`.
    *   **(17:47 - 18:33): Benchmarking Explanation & Code:** Shows the \`main_test.go\` file containing two benchmark functions: \`BenchmarkRequestReplyLoopback\` (calls \`RunEmbeddedServer(false, false)\`) and \`BenchmarkRequestReplyInProcess\` (calls \`RunEmbeddedServer(true, false)\`). Both run request-reply loops.
            *   *Code (Conceptual, based on \`main_test.go\` structure shown):*
                \`\`\`go
                // In main_test.go

                func BenchmarkRequestReplyLoopback(b *testing.B) {
                	nc, ns, err := RunEmbeddedServer(false, false) // Connect via network
                	if err != nil { b.Fatal(err) }
                	defer ns.Shutdown()
                	defer nc.Close()
                    // Add subscription similar to main
                    nc.Subscribe(...) 

                	b.ResetTimer()
                	for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
                		_, err := nc.Request("hello.world", []byte("hihi"), 10*time.Second)
                		if err != nil { b.Fatal(err) }
                	}
                	b.StopTimer()
                }

                func BenchmarkRequestReplyInProcess(b *testing.B) {
                	nc, ns, err := RunEmbeddedServer(true, false) // Connect via in-process
                    if err != nil { b.Fatal(err) }
                	defer ns.Shutdown()
                	defer nc.Close()
                    // Add subscription similar to main
                    nc.Subscribe(...) 

                	b.ResetTimer()
                	for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
                		_, err := nc.Request("hello.world", []byte("hihi"), 10*time.Second)
                		if err != nil { b.Fatal(err) }
                	}
                	b.StopTimer()
                }
                \`\`\`
            *   *Summary:* The speaker shows the benchmark code (\`main_test.go\`). Two benchmark functions are defined: one tests request-reply performance using the standard loopback network connection, and the other tests it using the optimized in-process connection by passing the appropriate flags to \`RunEmbeddedServer\`.
    *   **(18:33 - 19:43): Running Benchmarks & Showing Results:** Runs \`go test -bench=.\` in the terminal. Shows the output comparing the nanoseconds per operation for loopback vs. in-process, demonstrating the significant speedup of in-process. No new editor code.
    *   **(19:43 - 21:49): Adding JetStream & Leaf Node Config:** Modifies the \`server.Options\` in \`RunEmbeddedServer\` to enable JetStream, set a domain, and configure a Leaf Node connection to Synadia Cloud (\`connect.ngs.global\`) using credentials from a file.
            *   *Code (modifying \`opts\` in \`RunEmbeddedServer\`):*
                \`\`\`go
                	// ... (inside RunEmbeddedServer) ...
                	leafURL, err := url.Parse("nats-leaf://connect.ngs.global") // Define Leaf URL
                	if err != nil { return nil, nil, err }

                	opts := &server.Options{
                		ServerName:      "embedded_server", // Give server a name
                		DontListen:      inProcess,
                		JetStream:       true,             // Enable JetStream
                		JetStreamDomain: "embedded",       // Set JetStream domain

                		// Configure Leaf Node connection
                		LeafNode: server.LeafNodeOpts{
                			Remotes: []*server.RemoteLeafOpts{
                				{
                					URLs:        []*url.URL{leafURL},
                					Credentials: "./leafnode.creds", // Path to credentials file
                				},
                			},
                		},
                	}

                	// ... (rest of the function as before) ...
                \`\`\`
            *   *Summary:* The server options are expanded. \`ServerName\` is set. \`JetStream\` is enabled, and a \`JetStreamDomain\` ("embedded") is specified. Crucially, the \`LeafNode\` configuration block is added, defining a remote connection to Synadia Cloud (\`connect.ngs.global\`) using credentials loaded from a local \`leafnode.creds\` file.
    *   **(21:49 - 24:37): Running Leaf Node & Testing with CLI:** Runs the modified Go app. Shows the server logs indicating JetStream starting and the Leaf Node connection being established. Uses \`nats context select\` to switch the CLI to the Synadia Cloud context. Runs \`nats stream ls --js-domain embedded\` to list streams within the embedded domain via the cloud connection. Adds a stream \`nats stream add events --defaults --mirror events --js-domain office-hours-cli\` (adjusting slightly for clarity, video showed adding \`events_mirror\` mirroring \`events\` from the embedded domain). Lists streams again to show the new mirror stream.
    *   **(24:37 - End): Publishing events & final check:** Publishes 100 messages to \`events.123\` using the Synadia Cloud context (\`nats pub events.123 hello --count 100\`). Lists the streams again (\`nats s ls --js-domain office-hours-cli\`) showing the \`events_mirror\` now has 100 messages, demonstrating that data published to the embedded server was mirrored up to the cloud via the leaf node connection.

          text: `Okay, here are the Go code snippets shown in the video for embedding a NATS server, along with transcript summaries for context.

---

1.  **Timestamp: ~7:29**
    **Transcript Summary:** The speaker starts with a basic, empty Go \`main\` function as the starting point for the application.
    \`\`\`go
    package main

    func main() {

    }
    \`\`\`

---

2.  **Timestamp: ~7:35 - ~8:35** (Code built incrementally)
    **Transcript Summary:** The speaker creates a helper function \`RunEmbeddedServer\` to encapsulate the NATS server setup logic. This includes importing the necessary \`nats-server\` and \`nats.go\` packages, initializing default server options (\`&server.Options{}\`), creating the server instance using \`server.NewServer(opts)\`, and adding basic error handling. The function is set up to return a client connection, the server instance, and an error.
    \`\`\`go
    package main

    import (
        "errors"
        "log"
        "time"

        "github.com/nats-io/nats-server/v2/server"
        "github.com/nats-io/nats.go"
    )

    func main() {
        // ... will be filled later ...
    }

    // Function to run the embedded server
    func RunEmbeddedServer() (*nats.Conn, *server.Server, error) {
        opts := &server.Options{} // Initialize server options

        ns, err := server.NewServer(opts) // Create the server instance
        if err != nil {
            return nil, nil, err // Handle error during server creation
        }

        // Placeholder for server start and client connection
        // ...

        // Placeholder return
        return nil, ns, nil
    }
    \`\`\`
    *(Note: Imports like \`log\`, \`time\`, \`errors\` and the function return types are added during this segment).*

---

3.  **Timestamp: ~8:35 - ~10:07** (Code added within \`RunEmbeddedServer\`)
    **Transcript Summary:** The speaker adds code to start the NATS server in a separate goroutine (\`go ns.Start()\`) and then uses \`ns.ReadyForConnections()\` with a timeout to ensure the server is fully initialized and listening before proceeding. This prevents race conditions when the client tries to connect immediately.
    \`\`\`go
    	// (Inside RunEmbeddedServer, after ns, err := server.NewServer(opts))

    	go ns.Start() // Start the server in a background goroutine

    	// Wait for the server to be ready for connections, with a 5-second timeout
    	if !ns.ReadyForConnections(5 * time.Second) {
    		return nil, nil, errors.New("NATS Server timeout")
    	}

        // Placeholder for client connection
        // ...

        // Placeholder return
        return nil, ns, nil
    \`\`\`

---

4.  **Timestamp: ~10:07 - ~11:07** (Code added within \`RunEmbeddedServer\`)
    **Transcript Summary:** The speaker adds the client connection logic. \`nats.Connect()\` is called using the \`ns.ClientURL()\` method of the embedded server instance, which provides the URL the server is listening on (typically the default loopback address and port). Error handling is added for the connection attempt. The function now returns the actual client connection (\`nc\`) and server instance (\`ns\`).
    \`\`\`go
    	// (Inside RunEmbeddedServer, after readiness check)

    	// Connect a NATS client to the server's default URL
    	nc, err := nats.Connect(ns.ClientURL())
    	if err != nil {
    		return nil, nil, err // Handle connection error
    	}

    	// Return the connection, server instance, and no error
    	return nc, ns, nil
    } // End of RunEmbeddedServer
    \`\`\`

---

5.  **Timestamp: ~11:07 - ~12:51** (Code added within \`main\`)
    **Transcript Summary:** The speaker updates the \`main\` function to call \`RunEmbeddedServer\`, handle potential errors, and then creates a NATS subscription using the client connection (\`nc\`). This subscription listens on "hello.world" and responds to any request with "Hello there". \`ns.WaitForShutdown()\` is added to keep the main goroutine alive and the server running until interrupted.
    \`\`\`go
    func main() {
    	// Call the setup function (flags will be added later, defaulting to false, false here)
    	nc, ns, err := RunEmbeddedServer(false, false)
    	if err != nil {
    		log.Fatal(err)
    	}
    	defer ns.Shutdown() // Ensure server shutdown on exit
    	defer nc.Close()   // Ensure client connection closes on exit


    	// Subscribe to "hello.world" and respond
    	_, err = nc.Subscribe("hello.world", func(m *nats.Msg) {
    		m.Respond([]byte("Hello there"))
    	})
        if err != nil {
            log.Fatal(err) // Added error check for subscribe
        }


    	log.Println("Server setup complete, subscriber running. Waiting for shutdown...") // Added log message
    	// Block main goroutine until server shuts down
    	ns.WaitForShutdown()
    }
    \`\`\`
    *(Note: \`defer\` statements and the log message were added incrementally here).*

---

6.  **Timestamp: ~14:06 - ~15:02** (Modifications within \`RunEmbeddedServer\`)
    **Transcript Summary:** The \`RunEmbeddedServer\` function signature is modified to accept \`inProcess\` and \`enableLogging\` booleans. Inside, the \`server.Options\` are updated to set \`DontListen: inProcess\`. Conditional logic is added to call \`ns.ConfigureLogger()\` only if \`enableLogging\` is true.
    \`\`\`go
    // Modified function signature
    func RunEmbeddedServer(inProcess bool, enableLogging bool) (*nats.Conn, *server.Server, error) {
    	opts := &server.Options{
    		// Set DontListen based on the inProcess flag
    		DontListen: inProcess,
    	}

    	ns, err := server.NewServer(opts)
    	if err != nil {
    		return nil, nil, err
    	}

    	// Configure logger if enabled
    	if enableLogging {
    		ns.ConfigureLogger()
    	}

    	// (Server start and readiness check remain the same)
    	// go ns.Start() ...
        // if !ns.ReadyForConnections(...) ...

        // (Client connection logic will be modified next)
        // ...

        // (Return statement remains the same)
        // return nc, ns, nil
    }
    \`\`\`

---

7.  **Timestamp: ~15:02 - ~17:47** (Modifications within \`RunEmbeddedServer\`)
    **Transcript Summary:** The speaker modifies the client connection part to support in-process connections. A slice \`clientOpts\` of type \`[]nats.Option\` is created. If the \`inProcess\` flag is true, \`nats.InProcessServer(ns)\` is appended to \`clientOpts\`. This option instructs the client to connect directly to the server object in memory. Finally, \`clientOpts...\` is passed as a variadic argument to \`nats.Connect\`.
    \`\`\`go
    	// (Inside RunEmbeddedServer, after readiness check)

    	// Prepare client options slice
    	clientOpts := []nats.Option{}

    	// If inProcess is true, add the InProcessServer option
    	if inProcess {
    		clientOpts = append(clientOpts, nats.InProcessServer(ns))
    	}

    	// Connect the client using the server URL and potentially the in-process option
    	nc, err := nats.Connect(ns.ClientURL(), clientOpts...) // Pass variadic options
    	if err != nil {
    		// If we created the server, we should shut it down on connection error
    		ns.Shutdown()
            return nil, nil, err
    	}

    	return nc, ns, nil // Return values as before
    }
    \`\`\`
    *(Note: Improved error handling by adding \`ns.Shutdown()\` before returning the error was also shown here).*

---

8.  **Timestamp: ~19:43 - ~21:49** (Modifications within \`RunEmbeddedServer\`)
    **Transcript Summary:** The speaker further modifies the \`server.Options\` to enable JetStream (\`JetStream: true\`), define a domain (\`JetStreamDomain: "embedded"\`), and configure a Leaf Node connection. The \`LeafNode\` struct specifies remote URLs (parsing \`nats-leaf://connect.ngs.global\`) and the path to a credentials file (\`Credentials: "./leafnode.creds"\`).
    \`\`\`go
    	// (Inside RunEmbeddedServer, before server.NewServer)

    	// Define Leaf Node URL
    	leafURL, err := url.Parse("nats-leaf://connect.ngs.global")
    	if err != nil {
    		// Handle error appropriately, maybe return it
    		return nil, nil, err
    	}


    	opts := &server.Options{
    		ServerName:      "embedded_server", // Set a server name
    		DontListen:      inProcess,         // As before
    		JetStream:       true,              // Enable JetStream
    		JetStreamDomain: "embedded",        // Define JetStream domain

    		// Configure Leaf Node connection to Synadia Cloud
    		LeafNode: server.LeafNodeOpts{
    			Remotes: []*server.RemoteLeafOpts{
    				{
    					URLs:        []*url.URL{leafURL}, // Use the parsed URL
    					Credentials: "./leafnode.creds",  // Specify credentials file path
    				},
    			},
    		},
    	}

        // ns, err := server.NewServer(opts) ... rest of function follows
    \`\`\`
    *(Note: The \`url.Parse\` and its error handling were added here. Also import \`net/url\`)*
